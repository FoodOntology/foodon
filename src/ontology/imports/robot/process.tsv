FOODON:00002814	food treatment process	ikajime	Ikejime is a method of slaughtering fish to maintain the quality of its meat. The technique originated in Japan, but is now in widespread use. It involves the insertion of a spike quickly and directly into the hindbrain, usually located slightly behind and above the eye, thereby causing immediate brain death.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikejime	When spiked correctly, the fish fins flare and the fish relaxes, immediately ceasing all motion. Destroying the brain and the spinal cord of the fish will prevent reflex action from happening; such muscle movements would otherwise consume adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the muscle, and as a result produce lactic acid and ammonia, making the fish sour, soggy and less tasteful. Furthermore, the blood contained in the fish flesh retracts to the gut cavity, which produces a better coloured and flavoured fillet, and prolongs shelf life.

A similar technique, browning, is typically used to sear or brown all sides of a particular piece of meat, fish, poultry, etc. before finishing it in the oven. To obtain the desired brown crust, the meat surface must exceed 300 °F (150 °C), so searing requires the meat surface be free of water, which boils at around 212 °F (100 °C).

FOODON:00004069	food modification process	wine maceration	A food modification process which is a step in winemaking where the phenolic materials of the grape - tannins, coloring agents (anthocyanins) and flavor compounds - are leached from the grape skins, seeds and stems into the must.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maceration_(wine)																
FOODON:00004070	wine maceration	conventional maceration	A wine maceration process which occurs in a room temperature environment without other atmospheric controls.????																	
FOODON:00004071	wine maceration	hot maceration	A method of maceration involving high-temperature treatment of grape must before fermentation.	https://www.bio-conferences.org/articles/bioconf/full_html/2017/02/bioconf-oiv2017_02032	"Various techniques of thermo-maceration were developed on the basis of evolution of the industrial technologies. The extraction principle consists in heating the whole grapes or the crushed and destemmed grapes to high temperatures (65–80◦C), promoting the diffusion of phenolics from the skins, especially anthocyanins."[https://www.bio-conferences.org/articles/bioconf/full_html/2017/02/bioconf-oiv2017_02032]								thermo-maceration|thermomaceration|thermo-vinification							
FOODON:00004074	wine maceration	cold maceration	A wine maceration process in which  temperatures of the fermenting must are kept low to encourage extraction by water and added sulfur dioxide rather than relying principally on heat and alcohol to act as a solvent.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maceration_(wine)							https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0023643818304122		cold soak							
FOODON:00004072	wine maceration	limited maceration	A maceration process where seeds and skins of grapes are left in contact with juice or wine for a shorter period of time.																	
FOODON:00004073	wine maceration	extended maceration	A maceration process where seeds and skins of grapes are left in contact with juice or wine for a longer period of time.																	
FOODON:00004075	wine maceration	carbonic maceration	A maceration process in which whole grapes are fermented in a carbon dioxide rich environment before crushing.  Fermentation occurs within grape tissue, rather than from the skin surface.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonic_maceration	"This method involves filling a sealed vessel with carbon dioxide and then adding whole grapes or grape clusters. ... Carbonic maceration ferments most of the juice while it is still inside the grape, although grapes at the bottom of the vessel are crushed by gravity and undergo conventional fermentation."[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonic_maceration]		grape													
																				
	alcohol fermentation	normal alcohol fermentation	Conventional alcoholic fermentation involves crushing the grapes to free the juice and pulp from the skin with yeast serving to convert sugar into ethanol. 																	
	alcohol fermentation	double alcohol fermentation																		
	alcohol fermentation	primary alcohol fermentation																		
	wine alcohol fermentation	wine secondary alcohol fermentation	The secondary stage of a wine alcohol fermentation and aging process, which takes three to six months, in which the fermentation continues very slowly. The wine is kept under an airlock to protect the wine from oxidation.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winemaking#Secondary_(malolactic)_fermentation_and_bulk_aging									malolactic alcohol fermentation

FOODON:00004088	heating container	direct heating of container	A heating container process in which the container conducts heat by being in proximity to an open flame, a hot surface or an oven.		The challenge here is to make a clean distinction between methods that immerse a cooking container in water or steam vs those that don't.															
FOODON:00004089	heating container	heating liquid in container	A heating container process in which the temperature of contained liquid is raised to a threshold.
