# FoodOn Food Ontology

Description: FoodOn, the food ontology, contains vocabulary for naming food materials and their anatomical and taxonomic origins, from raw harvested food to processed food products, for humans and domesticated animals. As an open-source inter-agency supported project, it provides a neutral and ontology-driven standard for government agencies, industry, nonprofits and consumers to name and reference food products and their components throughout the food supply chain. In partnership with other ontologies, the project also explores the semantic bedrock of vocabulary involved in modelling food composition, food processing, nutrition and food related disease.

FoodOn was initially based on a conversion of the [LanguaL.org](http://langual.org) food indexing thesaurus, integrated with OBOFoundry ontology terms from UBERON, ChEBI, and NCBITaxon and others.

## To view

An easy place to browse FoodOn is at [https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/foodon](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/foodon). As well the URI's of terms in the ontology resolve to the comprehensive [Ontobee ontology lookup service](http://www.ontobee.org/). It is organized according to the upper level BFO ontology, so most terms can be browsed by starting at the BFO "entity" term (e.g. in [Ontobee](http://www.ontobee.org/ontology/FOODON?iri=http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000001)).
